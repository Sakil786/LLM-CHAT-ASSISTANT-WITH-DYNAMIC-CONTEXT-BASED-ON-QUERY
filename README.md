### DATA SOURCES
To keep things straightforward, Iâ€™ve opted for two data sources.
- [PDF](https://github.com/Sakil786/LLM_Accuracy/blob/main/Health%20Companion-Health%20Insurance%20Plan_GEN617.pdf "PDF"): The initial data source is a PDF obtained through internet
- [LIC](https://licindia.in/web/guest/know-your-life-insurance "LIC") : This data source corresponds to the website link of LIC.

It equips us with essential tools to enhance ourLarge Language Model (LLM) applications by effortlessly incorporating diverse datasets.
